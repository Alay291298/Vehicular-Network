1. Introduction
Urban traffic congestion continues to pose a significant challenge, increasing travel times, fuel consumption, and emissions. Smart cities initiatives focus on leveraging technology to improve transportation efficiency and address these issues. Vehicular networks (VNets) offer a promising approach by enabling vehicles to communicate with each other and infrastructure, providing real-time traffic information and facilitating cooperative decision-making. [2]
This project proposes developing a Dynamic Traffic Management System (DTMS) for Smart Cities using Vehicular Networks[1]. This system will utilize real-time data from connected vehicles to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve overall transportation efficiency. This project is feasible for a team of two within a semester timeframe by focusing on a specific aspect of the overall system.

This project proposes a feasible and impactful implementation of a Dynamic Traffic Management System (DTMS) for Smart Cities leveraging the power of Vehicular Networks (VNet). By focusing on Dynamic Traffic Signal Control, we aim to develop and evaluate an algorithm that dynamically adjusts traffic signal timings based on real-time vehicle data from V2X communication, aiming to reduce congestion and improve travel time at intersections and ultimately contribute to improved urban traffic flow, reduced emissions, and a more efficient transportation system.
